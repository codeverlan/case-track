# BMAD Implementation Plan: Legal Case Relationship Tracking System

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Approach**: BMAD Framework Integration + Application Development
**Status**: Approved for Implementation

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Hybrid BMAD + Application Development

**Core Principle**: Maintain BMAD framework infrastructure while building functional legal case tracking application

**BMAD Components to Leverage**:
1. **BMAD Master Agent**: Orchestrate all development activities
2. **BMB (Builder Module)**: Create legal application specific agents and workflows
3. **BMM Development Agents**: Execute technical implementation
4. **Existing Documentation System**: Maintain markdown-based tracking

## BMAD Development Workflow

### Phase 1: BMAD Module Creation

**1. Create Legal Application Module**
- Use BMB to create custom agents for legal case tracking
- Build specialized workflows for legal application development
- Integrate with existing BMAD infrastructure

**2. BMAD Master Coordination**
- Activate BMAD Master to orchestrate development
- Use existing agent ecosystem for project management
- Maintain BMAD documentation standards

### Phase 2: Application Development

**1. Backend Development (Node.js + SQLite)**
- Use BMAD Developer Agent for implementation
- Leverage BMAD Architecture Agent for database design
- Follow BMAD testing frameworks

**2. Frontend Development (React + TypeScript)**
- Use BMAD UX Expert for interface design
- Leverage BMAD Developer Agent for React components
- Maintain BMAD code quality standards

**3. Custom Field Framework**
- Use BMAD Builder Module to create extensible system
- Leverage BMAD Creative Innovation Specialists for unique features
- Maintain flexibility for legal domain requirements
