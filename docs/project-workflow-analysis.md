# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Project:** case-track
**Analyst:** Tyler

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** 3
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md (Level 3+ PRD workflow)

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Fast web-based database for tracking complex relationships in legal cases, built on SQLite with modern React frontend. Central contacts database with customizable fields, focused on relationship complexity tracking in legal domain.
- **Estimated Stories:** 16 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 4 epics
- **Timeline:** 4 weeks MVP implementation

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** greenfield
- **Existing Documentation:** Sprint Change Proposal, BMAD Implementation Plan, Technical Decisions Template
- **Team Size:** Small (1-3 developers with BMAD framework support)
- **Deployment Intent:** Web-based application with single-tenant SQLite deployment

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

- **PRD.md** - Complete Product Requirements Document with FRs, NFRs, epics, and stories
- **epics.md** - Detailed epic breakdown with story mapping
- **tech-spec.md** - Technical specifications for implementation
- **architecture.md** - Scale-adaptive solution architecture (Level 3+ requirement)
- **ux-specification.md** - User interface and experience specifications

### Workflow Sequence

1. **PRD Generation** (Level 3 workflow)
   - Functional Requirements (FRs)
   - Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
   - Epic definition and story breakdown
   - Success criteria and performance requirements

2. **Solution Architecture** (architect agent)
   - System architecture and technology stack
   - Database schema design
   - API design and integration patterns
   - Component boundaries and interactions

3. **Technical Specifications** (per epic)
   - Implementation details for each epic
   - Database schemas and migrations
   - API contracts and validation
   - Testing strategies and acceptance criteria

4. **UX Specifications** (UX expert agent)
   - Screen designs and user flows
   - Component library and design system
   - Responsive design requirements
   - Accessibility considerations

### Next Actions

- Generate comprehensive PRD with all epics and stories
- Create solution architecture document
- Develop UX specifications for legal professional interface
- Generate technical specifications for each epic
- Route to development agents for implementation

## Special Considerations

- **BMAD Framework Integration:** Leverage existing BMAD infrastructure for development workflow management
- **Legal Domain Specificity:** Not typical legal aid software - requires modern, streamlined approach
- **Custom Field Framework:** Core differentiator requiring extensible data model
- **Relationship Complexity:** Central focus on tracking complex legal case relationships
- **Performance Requirements:** Fast web interface for legal professional productivity

## Technical Preferences Captured

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + SQLite
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database:** SQLite with custom field schema framework
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing strategy using BMAD frameworks
- **Documentation:** Markdown-based with BMAD compliance
